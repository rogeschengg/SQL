# For this project, I downloaded a database from this link "https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/dRmwOLQsS22FVFbXfh3x"
# Here are some example questions I came up with while answering them using this database

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA'

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i

4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Agent'

# This query showed no results. I examined the database and found that there are no
"Sales Agent." I made a small change to the query to showcase the Sales Agent #

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Agent'

# This query showed all employees who are Sales Agent #

5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM invoices

6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
  The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.invoiceId = cust.CustomerId
