# For this project, I downloaded a database from this link "https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/dRmwOLQsS22FVFbXfh3x"
# Here are some example questions I came up with while answering them using this database

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA'

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i

4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Agent'

# This query showed no results. I examined the database and found that there are no
"Sales Agent." I made a small change to the query to showcase the Sales Agent #

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Agent'

# This query showed all employees who are Sales Agent #

5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM invoices

6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
  The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.invoiceId = cust.CustomerId

7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT
cust.FirstName AS cust_FirstName,
cust.LastName AS cust_LastName,
emp.FirstName AS emp_FirstName,
emp.LastName AS emp_LastName,
cust.country,
inv.Total
FROM customers cust
JOIN employees emp ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM tracks t
JOIN invoice_items i ON i.InvoiceLineId = t.TrackId

11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, t.Composer, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM tracks t
JOIN invoice_items i ON i.InvoiceLineId= t.TrackId

# There are many entries that have no artist name. To query for those that have artist names
 I made a small change to the query #

SELECT t.Name, t.Composer, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM tracks t
JOIN invoice_items i ON i.InvoiceLineId = t.TrackId
WHERE composer <> ''

12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS track_name,
a.Title AS album_name,
m.Name AS media_name,
g.Name AS genre_name
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN media_types m ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres g ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId

13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT
emp.FirstName,
emp.LastName,
SUM(inv.Total) AS total
FROM employees emp
JOIN customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title LIKE '%Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName, emp.LastName

14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT
emp.FirstName,
emp.LastName,
SUM(inv.Total) AS total
FROM employees emp
JOIN customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title LIKE '%Agent'
AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
ORDER BY total DESC
